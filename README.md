# Eulerian-Video-Magnification
Eulerian Video Magnification (EVM) is a computational technique that reveals subtle changes in videos that are otherwise invisible to the naked eye. By amplifying minute color and motion variations, EVM can visualize phenomena like the pulse of blood flow in a person's face or tiny structural vibrations.

# Features
1. Motion Magnification: Enhance small movements to make subtle motions visible.
2. Color Amplification: Amplify slight color changes to reveal hidden details.
3. Flexible Parameters: Adjust spatial and temporal frequencies for targeted magnification.
4. Easy Integration: Compatible with various video processing workflows.
